# Backpack
This is a minecraft data pack.  
only `"backpack/"` is a real data pack, and `"x/"`, `"y/"` are templates, they preset a type of slot in the backpack
* `"x/"` means this slot can put a itemstack in, however, backpack put in will be dropped.
* `"z/"` means this slot can't put any thing, so item put into it will be dropped and replaced by `"brown_stained_glass_pane"`. 

and you can download it from this repos, or my other websites (recommended)
